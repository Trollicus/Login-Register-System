# Login-Register-System

A Project I started a few months ago. 
It's a Login/Register PHP System with which by creating a brand new account it includes an Key that you have to "buy".

## What featurers does it has?

- Verification System
- Password Generating(20+ lenght by default, Password is sent to the given email) 
- Discord Admin Bot(Blacklisting/banning users, adding Key(s)/Tokens)

## Videos of me using it
